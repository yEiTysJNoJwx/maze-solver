# Maze Solver
*Generates mazes and solves them!*

___

The Maze Solver uses several different algorithms to find the fastest way to the end of the maze. These algorithms include but are not limited to
* Depth-based Search
* Breadth-based Search.

This project is currently in development and the maze generation algorithm can be improved. Any suggestions will be considered.
